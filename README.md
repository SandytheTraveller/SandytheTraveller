Hi everyone, I'm Aleksandra!
I’m a Software Engineer with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Software Engineering. My work spans across developing AI models for visual data analysis, exploring NLP applications, and building robust software solutions.


Some highlights of my work:

🌐 * Computer Vision projects like Satellite Imagery Feature Detection using U-Net.

🛠️ * Proficiency in Python, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, and full-stack development.

🤖 * Experience with NLP, working on projects that apply Large Language Models (LLMs) for tasks like information extraction and fuzzy matching.

💻 * Enthusiast for combining software engineering principles with AI to build scalable, real-world applications.


I’m excited about solving complex problems through AI, whether it's in vision, language, or software systems. Always open to collaboration and eager to contribute to open-source and innovative projects!
